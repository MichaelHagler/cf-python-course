Exercise 1.2:

I used a dictionary for each recipe because I can create key-value pairs and even store a secondary list for my ingredients. Each recipe has values for the name of the recipe, cook time, and ingredients.

I created a list to hold all my dictionary entries. Putting everything in a master list will allow me change the items as needed because a list is mutable.
